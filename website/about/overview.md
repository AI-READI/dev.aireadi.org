# Overview

## About AI-READI

AI-READI is one of the data generation projects of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Bridge2AI Program. The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health.
