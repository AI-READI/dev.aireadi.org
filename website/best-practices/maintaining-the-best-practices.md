# Maintaining the best practices

This document will be used to establish the first version of the best practices (v1.0), since Google Docs facilitates collaborative inputs. Once v1.0 is finalized, we will publish v1.0 of the best practices in the "[software-best-practices](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-best-practices)" repository in the AI-READI GitHub organization and maintain all future versions from there. The best practices will be shared openly under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

The README of that repository will contain elements of Sections 1 and 2 of this document. For v1.0, we will include a PDF version of this document as well as a markdown version of the best practices (Section 3) and a markdown version of the design rationale for the best practices (Section 4). Future modifications and suggestions can be made by submitting a pull request with edits on the markdown versions (no PDF versions will be included after v1.0). Such edits could be made, for instance, to improve v1.0 or align with potential best practices agreed upon by the Bridge2AI consortium. A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will be added to the repository with instructions on how to suggest edits to the best practices. These pull requests will be reviewed and approved by the Tools module PIs with inputs from other modules PIs or team members if required. A dedicated folder will be created for each version in the "software-best-practices" repository such that they are all preserved. A `CHANGELOG.md` will be maintained to document changes between versions.

A GitHub release will be created for each new version of the best practices. The GitHub repository will also be archived on Zenodo such that each version of the best practices can be referenced with a unique digital object identifier (DOI). Additionally, the latest version of best practices will be visible on dev.aireadi.org, the developer documentation website for the AI-READI project. This documentation will display the best practices in a user-friendly manner and will contain additional elements (e.g., code snippets) such that the best practices can be easily implemented by developers (see [dev.fairdataihub.org](https://dev.fairdataihub.org/) for an example).
