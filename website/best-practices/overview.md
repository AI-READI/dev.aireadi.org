# Overview

Given the complexity of the Bridge2AI projects, it is critical to establish software development best practices for both the tools module and the other stakeholders. This is reflected in Milestone 1.1.1 of the Tools Module of our Bridge2AI data generation project, AI-READI: "Establish software development practices to follow for the project." Briefly, the goal of this milestone is to establish project-wide best practices to be followed by anyone developing code for the AI-READI project. The rationales for establishing these best practices are to:

- Help the standardization of the AI-READI software to facilitate future reuse, i.e. make the AI-READI software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)
- Ensure the efficient and effective development of software across the project, especially when contributions from several teams are required
- Facilitate on-boarding of new developers to the project

Our focus here is on establishing actionable best practices that can be directly implemented by developers of the project. These best practices are intended to remain general enough such that they can apply to any software development project within AI-READI.
